   "tip1":"Tip #2. Support Caching for Offline ApplicationsIt’s important to utilize caching of data that is bound to grids whenever possible. Caching can reduce or eliminate the need to issue HTTP requests and can greatly improve the overall performance and scalability of your web apps. Most of the time, HTTP caching will help as well through the response headers returned by the web server when data is requested. However, there are scenarios in which it’s useful to have grids support a local cache of data on the client itself. Offline application support is one such scenario where local caching can greatly improve the overall user experience.",
